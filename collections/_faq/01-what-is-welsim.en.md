WelSim was incorporated in January of 2017 to develop an improved and affordable simulation software program. We are building the WelSim to improve the global adoption of engineering simulation and scientific computing. WELSIM is the first enterprise-grade engineering simulation software with friendly licensing options. In addition to the flagship product, WelSim also developed free engineering software including MatEditor, UnitConverter, CurveFitter, and BeamSection.
