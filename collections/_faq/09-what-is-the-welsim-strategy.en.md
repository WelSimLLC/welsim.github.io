title: "What is the WelSim strategy?"
---

It is our belief that the engineering simulation industry is still led by users. We intend to be the superior simulation software for R&D tools and services as well as being the only serious and affordable choice for the community. The WelSim business will be first for profit company that contribute to universities, large coorperations, small business, and individuals. We believe that - as Redhat and MySQL AB were necessary to drive corporate adoption of linux and mysql - we will be the source for support and training as sovereigns, research institutions, and corporations look to use simulation tools in daily innovation. Finally, we believe that we will be able to leverage simulation technology to drive more adaption at corporations and end usersã€‚
