We believe that more high-quality and easy-to-use simulation software will only make the world better. As veterans of the simulation industry, we have heard too many complaints that simulation software is very hard to use and too expensive, such a situation has negatively impacted the innovations of human beings, many small businesses and talented researchers cannot afford the enterprise-grade simulation software, we have partially solved this issue and keep working on helping those researchers, scientists, engineers, and instructors.
