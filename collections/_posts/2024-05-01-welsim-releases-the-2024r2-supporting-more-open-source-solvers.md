## Added support for CalculiX
The new 2024R2 version adds a pre-processing module for the CalculiX solver, allowing users to quickly generate input scripts required for CalculiX computation, or directly call CalculiX for solving through WELSIM.

</p>

Currently, 60 commands are supported, which accounts for 42% of all CalculiX commands. All of which are core commands, capable of common analysis needs.

## Added support for Elmer FEM
The new version adds pre-processing support for Elmer FEM, allowing users to quickly generate input scripts required for Elmer FEM calculations. Upon successful export, a solver input script named elmer_welsim.sif will be generated, along with a mesh dataset consisting of four files named mesh.header, mesh.nodes, mesh.elements, and mesh.boundary.

</p>

Users can also directly call Elmer FEM for calculations through WELSIM. Currently supported Elmer equations include: Coil Solver, Fluidic Force, Free Surface Reduced, Heat Equation, MagnetoDynamics, Mesh Update, Navier-Stokes, Poisson BEM, Save Line, Save Scalars, Static Electrical Solver, Static Current Solver, Stress Analysis, Stream Solver, etc.

WELSIM introduced a new Additional Solver object to support users in adding various Elmer solver settings.

## Enhancements
To conclude, the 2024R2 version has new features and improvements, such as adding a search function to the solver output window, and supporting the import and export of csv format files for the table window. WELSIM has added a specific gas constant material property. Furthermore, the free material editing software MatEditor has added the feature to export material data in CalculiX and Elmer FEM formats.

</p>


The automatic testing system has become more user-friendly and contains more tests. WELSIM has created support for reading and saving of test group files *.wstb, and support for the deletion of selected test cases. WELSIM now also provides system-level operations, such as deleting local files and confirming specified files. In the new 2024R2 version, more than 200 test cases can be found and utilized.
