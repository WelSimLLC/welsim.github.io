For users conducting CAE analysis, material definition is a meticulous and laborious process. It is meticulous because material parameters are crucial for simulation results, requiring confirmation of the accuracy of each parameter. It is laborious when dealing with numerous materials and diverse properties, as defining and editing attributes becomes a substantial task. Using scripts to define materials proves to be an effective method. The large-scale general simulation CAE software, WELSIM, supports script-defined materials through an automated testing system, facilitating the definition of a considerable material dataset using XML scripts.

This article demonstrates, through examples, the method of script-based creation of a large dataset of materials in WELSIM.

1. Build a single material data through GUI. (If familiar with XML syntax, you can also refer to existing XML test files and write your own). Activate the test recording function.

</p>


Create a new material object, naming it Mat001. Open the material editing panel and sequentially add density, isotropic elasticity, and bilinear isotropic hardening properties, these properties are commonly used in elastic-plastic models.

Input the relevant parameters. After completing the editing operations, the material properties should appear as follows:

</p>


2. Test a single material data file.

Click the stop recording button, and the macro command for graphical operations is recorded, generating the script. Open the recorded XML file with a text editor, make slight modifications, delete redundant lines, and obtain the script for a single material. The green-boxed part in the figure below indicates the modifications for other materials, expanding to derive additional materials. These include the material object's position in the project tree window, material name, material object ID, and material property parameters.

</p>


3. Copy and paste a single material, making necessary modifications.

Copy and paste the text from the figure, modifying the green-boxed part to create a new material. This article creates a total of 21 materials. The parameters for material properties, all using bilinear isotropic hardening plasticity, are listed in the table below.

</p>


4. Complete the script, run, and debug.

With the script editing completed, it can be run and tested. After running, proceed directly to the subsequent simulation analysis tasks. Alternatively, material data can be exported for use in other software. The materials exported from WELSIM can be opened in MatEditor, as shown in the figure below.

## Conclusion
The script file used in this example is open-source and saved in the WELSIM public test library under the filename *"06018_create_multiple_materials.xml"*. This example creates a total of 21 material datasets, each with similar properties but differing numerical values. Additionally, different material properties can be added in the script, supporting a more diverse material dataset.

Using scripts to establish material datasets effectively saves editing time, reduces errors, and is easy to maintain. Scripts can be modified easily for use in other material datasets, showcasing strong extensibility. It is an ideal method for quickly creating and maintaining large material datasets.

The script language for material definition may vary depending on the CAE software. In this example, XML is used, other CAE software may use different languages, such as Python or JavaScript.
