In the engineering design and calculation practice, various unit systems will be encountered. It is very important to convert these engineering quantities accurately and quickly. WELSIM recently released a free unit converter application — UnitConverter. This application helps engineers convert quantity values between units correctly and quickly.

Currently, this application supports 15 default unit systems, including:

SI (kg, m, s, K, A, N, V)
MKS Standard (kg, m, s, C, A, N, V)
NMMTON Standard (t, mm, s, C, A, N, mV)
BIN Standard (lbm,in,s,F,A,lbf,V)
US Engineering (lb,in,s,R,A,lbf,V)
CGS Standard (g, cm, s, C, A, dyne, V)
NMM Standard (kg, mm, s, C, mA, N, mV)
UMKS Standard (kg, um, s, C, mA, uN, V)
NMMDAT Standard (dt, mm, s, C, mA, N, mV)
BFT Standard (lbm, ft, s, F, A, lbf, V)
CGS Consistent (g, m, s, C, A, dyne, V)
NMM Consistent (t,m,s,mC,mA,t*mm/s2,mV)
UMKS Consistent (kg, m, s, pC, pA, uN, pV)
BIN Consistent (slinch,in,s,C,A,slinch*in/s2,V)
BFT Consistent (slug, ft, s, C, A, slug*ft/s2, V)

Due to a large number of unit quantities, UnitConverter groups all units into six categories: Basic, Common, Mechanical, Thermal, Electrical, and Magnetic. The supported units for each category are described below.

The Base units support Angle, Current, Length, Mass, Temperature, and Time.
