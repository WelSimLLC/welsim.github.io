Shockwaves are a complex physical phenomenon. When an object's velocity exceeds the speed of sound of medium, shockwaves are generated at the points where the object's surface changes. Shockwaves can occur in gases as well as in liquids, although they are less common in liquids due to their higher speed of sound. One of the most common instances of shockwaves is generated when aircraft break the sound barrier (at approximately 340 meters per second) while flying within the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, shockwaves can be generated in various situations such as within supersonic aircraft engines and nozzles, explosives, and more.

When an aircraft is flying at supersonic speeds, the air in front of the aircraft experiences a sudden compression, forming a concentrated compression interface known as a shockwave. Shockwaves exhibit strong nonlinearity. When passing through a shockwave, the properties of the medium (typically gas) such as pressure, density, and temperature, undergo a sudden increase while the velocity abruptly decreases. Essentially, this is a process where kinetic energy is converted into pressure energy. Additionally, the rapid increase in pressure results in a loud sonic boom as some of the energy is transformed into acoustic wave energy. Due to the abrupt change in gas density at the shockwave location, we can capture images of shockwaves, and in modern designs of almost all supersonic wind tunnels, observation ports or recording positions are included.


The thickness of a shockwave depends on the type of gas and the velocity of the moving object. In the case of an ideal gas, shockwaves have no thickness and are considered as physical discontinuities. However, real gases have viscosity and thermal conductivity, which makes shockwaves continuous but still very thin. In engineering, shockwaves are often approximated as discontinuities. Moreover, as the Mach number increases, the shockwave thickness decreases.

In engineering, we often need to consider the changes in pressure and velocity of the fluid before and after a shockwave. The traditional approach involves using the method of characteristics, along with consulting manuals and charts to find the pressure and velocity transformations for a specific gas. Nowadays, with the maturity of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) technology, we can obtain preliminary numerical solutions on a computer within minutes. Furthermore, we can obtain more complex results involving multiple interacting shockwaves.

Numerically, due to the distinct discontinuities associated with shockwaves, traditional finite element methods may not be the most suitable. Finite volume methods (FVM) with Riemann solvers as core algorithms have shown great adaptability in the CFD field, especially in the realm of compressible fluid dynamics. Therefore, in the CFD field, particularly in compressible fluid CFD, FVM has excelled.

## Performing Supersonic CFD Simulations with SU2 andÂ WELSIM

Below, we'll demonstrate how to conduct transient CFD analysis for supersonic flow using examples.

(1) Taking a two-dimensional model as an example, after opening WELSIM, create a new project and set the model as a 2D transient fluid model.

Click the Solve button. Since this is a transient simulation, it will require a significant amount of physical computation time based on the mesh density and duration. After the calculation is complete, add nodes for Mach number and pressure results and display contour plots. The following figures show the Mach number in the flow field at 0.002 seconds and the pressure field at 0.00125 seconds. Clearly, shockwaves are generated and interact with each other.
