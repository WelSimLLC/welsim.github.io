## 1. Download software installer

Click the “Install” button, and it will start the installation. During this process, it will prompt whether to install Visual C++ 2015, Intel Fortran 2017, and Microsoft MPI dependent packages, these libraries are required for WELSIM software runtime. If your computer doesn't have these dependent libraries installed, click “Yes.”

If you don’t want to activate the software for the moment, just select “Evaluate” to continue the trial. However, if you want to activate WELSIM, click on the “Generate Computer ID” button to generate a string of characters. Send this string to info@welsim.com, and you will receive the license key file.
