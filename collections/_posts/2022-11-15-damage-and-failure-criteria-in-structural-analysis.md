With the development of simulation technology, engineers and scientists are more and more interested in the damage, fracture, failure, destruction and other phenomena on the top of conventional analysis. For example, in shock and dynamics, the ideal failure model can predict the elements that should be deleted or propagate cracks, and show the results of the analysis objects under extraordinary loads. Combined with post-processing tools, the simulation results can be not only accurate, but also vivid. We have often seen the application of failure models in the crash analysis of automobiles and aircraft.

In actual engineering, mechanical failure can occur in various conditions. Such as large deformation, buckling, bending, brittle fracture, ductile fracture, creep, wear, fatigue crack propagation, delamination, etc. In addition, there are also various thermal failures, chemical failures, electrical failures, etc. These failures have permanent effects on objects and will also bring certain safety hazards to peopleâ€™s production and life. The failure and damage models can effectively avoid disasters through pre-analysis. At the same time, with the rise of the metaverse in recent years, various failure models will also have a large number of applications in the metaverse.

## Quantities in Failure Models
There are many damage models, including general-purpose models and fine models for specific materials or working conditions. In general, these models are represented by calculating the damage quantity, which is usually represented by the letter D in the math formula. When D is greater than a certain value, it is considered that the material damage reaches a certain level and begins to fail. Most models define D to be a value between 0 and 1. When D is less than 1, the structure is free. When D is greater than or equal to 1, it is determined that the material fails.

The calculation of D value is the key to distinguish different failure models, and it is generally obtained through the results on the elemental integration points such as strain, stress, and strain energy density. The most common basic quantity of failure model is strain, such as plastic strain, total strain, etc., because the strain quantity is easy to obtain and is less influenced by other physical quantities, it is widely used in failure models. There are also some failure models based on stress, such as some brittle materials. Failure models based on strain energy density are often used in metal forming process. Some failure models also take fatigue as the basic quantity, and this kind of model often has an integral form to measure the accumulated damage. In addition, some models take thermal effects into account, allowing the models to be used in scenarios where there are temperature variations.

## Numerical Processing after Failure
In modern engineering simulation software, when the algorithm determines that the element is failed, it will make corresponding numerical processing. Common processing methods are:

1. Delete the element. Since the part has failed, the local element is deleted for subsequent computation.

2. Crack propagation. If it is a small local failure, XFEM and other methods can be used to expand the crack and convey influence of the failed element on the surrounding elements.

</p>

3. Stress elimilation and softening. Make the stress of the current element to zero or reduce it artificially. Comparing to element deletion and crack propagation, it consumes less computational resources and is easy to implement in development. Among them, stress softening is a method often used in the failure of hyperelastic materials.

For solid elements, you can decide whether to process the element according to a single integration point or multiple integration points. For shell elements, the element can be processed based on a single layeror multiple layers.

## Conclusion
There are many types of failure models that are still under development. Various failure models bring the icing on the cake to the engineering simulation analysis. This article focuses on mechanical failure only. Other types of failures such as electrical failures, radiation failures, chemical failures, etc. will be discussed in future articles.
