    Mainnet Release
    --------------------

    We believe that cryptocurrency should be easier to use than cash, harder to lose, and nearly impossible to steal. Anyone who wants to validate transactions should be able to farm without single-use hardware or a big electricity bill.

    On February 9th we released our [Business Whitepaper](https://www.chia.net/2021/02/10/chia-businesss-whitepaper.html) and mainnet launched for farming rewards on Friday March 19, 2021. Transactions were enabled on May 3, 2021. You may also be interested in our [new consensus working document](/assets/Chia-New-Consensus-0.9.pdf) which was implemented first in Beta 19 on January 12, 2021.

    Chia Network develops a blockchain and smart transaction platform created by the inventor of BitTorrent, [Bram Cohen](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/chia-vs-bitcoin/). It implements the first new Nakamoto consensus algorithm since Bitcoin in 2008. Proofs of Space and Time replace energy intensive “proofs of work.”

    [Chialisp](https://chialisp.com) is Chia’s new on chain programming language that is powerful, easy to audit, and secure. It will make cryptocurrency easier to use than cash. Reference smart transactions currently available are: [Coloured coins](https://www.chia.net/2020/04/29/coloured-coins-launch.en.html), [rate-limited wallets](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/tree/main/chia/wallet/rl_wallet), and [distributed identity wallets](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/tree/main/chia/wallet/did_wallet). Bram introduces [Chialisp](https://www.chia.net/2019/11/27/chialisp.en.html) on our [blog](/blog) and you can learn more at [Chialisp.com](https://chialisp.com).

    You should review the [release notes](download/#release-notes) and then [install](/download) Chia blockchain.

    The Green Paper details a new consensus algorithm called Proofs of Space and Time, “PoST”. PoST replaces the Proof of Work which wastes massive amounts of energy and is less secure against mining centralization.
  green_paper_addendum_title: "Learn more"
  green_paper_addendum: | 
    We have academic papers and presentations that give detail about our new consensus algorithm and blockchain software. In 2019 we revealed our [Green Paper](https://www.chia.net/assets/ChiaGreenPaper.pdf) outlining the construction of Proofs of Space and Time and illustrating many of the design choices of Chia. There is also a [2019 talk from Mariano Sorgente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_075bzQPooU) at MIT on how to achieve Nakamoto consensus with Proof of Space and VDFs.

    Bram Cohen [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zlcgt8FVz4) at Stanford on February 2018 on Proofs of Space. Our advisors, Dan Boneh, Benedikt Bünz, and Ben Fisch [published a survey of VDFs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf) which are the underlying technology of Proof of Time. Lipa Long [published an explanation of class groups](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) that our [Proofs of Time](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf) is based on. Bram presented [Beyond Hellman’s Time-Memory Trade-Offs with Applications to Proofs of Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxkO7C-cyk) at BPASE ‘18 in January 2018 based on the [academic paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893) and these [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/pbase18slides/page/1) by Hamza Abusalah. Ben Fisch gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUoagL7OZ1k) at BPASE 2018 in January 2018 on Verifiable Delay Functions. Bram [spoke at Blockchain at Berkeley](https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainatBerkeley/videos/2006069823011271/) (which starts about 20:00) in March 2018 with [slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf). Bram gave a [talk at BPASE 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYG0NxoG7yw) in January 2017 on removing waste with Proofs of Space and Time ([slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf)).

    Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about data structures for scaling Bitcoin with [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/bitcoin_data_structures/) and [Merkle Set code](https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet). Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about removing waste from cryptocurrencies.

    Chia的Beta测试网
    -------------

    Chia Network是由BitTorrent的創始人[Bram Cohen](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/chia-vs-bitcoin/)創建的區塊鍊和智能交易平台。它的灵感与比特币区块链相似，但是在Chia中，资源不是计算能力，而是磁盘空间。为此，将能源密集型“工作量证明”替换为“空间量证明”，因此磁盘空间成为验证交易而非能源的主要资源。

    Beta测试网推出了Chialisp的第一个版本，即Chia的智能事务编程语言。当前可用的智能交易有：[原子交换](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/atomic_swaps.md)，[授权收款人](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/authorised_pa​​yees.md)，[可恢复的钱包](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/recoverable_wallet.md)，[multisig钱包](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/multisig/README.org)和[限价钱包](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/rate_limited_wallet.md)。 Chia Network的创始人和BitTorrent的前创始人在[Chialisp](https://www.chia.net/2019/11/27/chialisp.en.html)上有更多内容。

    Beta测试网还引入了Chia的区块链共识层，其中包括一个完整的节点，农民和时间主。

    由于这是Beta版本，因此您可能需要查看[release notes](download/#release-notes)。

    区块链
    ---

    Chia的区块链包括一个完整的节点，农民和时间领主。在[GitHub](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain)上下载源代码。

    Chialisp和LedgerSim
    ------------------

    LedgerSim支持在账本而非区块链上进行Chialisp智能交易，以进行测试和开发。 Chia的钱包展示了我们的新编程语言Chialisp。在[GitHub](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets)上下载源代码。

    Chia Network是一个去中心化的开源全球区块链，与传统的工作量证明加密货币相比，其浪费更少，去中心化程度更高，更安全。它的灵感与比特币区块链相似，但是在Chia中，资源不是计算能力，而是磁盘空间。为了实现这一目标，比特币中使用的“工作证明”被“空间证明”代替，因此磁盘空间成为达成分散式“中本聪式”共识以验证交易的主要资源和时间证明。

    Chia网络还是一家智能交易平台公司。

  green_paper_addendum_title: "学到更多"
  green_paper_addendum: |
    我们有学术论文和演讲，详细介绍了我们的新共识算法和区块链软件。在2019年，我们发布了《绿皮书》（https://www.chia.net/assets/ChiaGreenPaper.pdf），概述了空间和时间证明的构造，并说明了Chia的许多设计选择。麻省理工学院也有[2019年Mariano Sorgente的演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_075bzQPooU），内容涉及如何通过空间证明和VDF实现Nakamoto共识。

    布拉姆·科恩（Bram Cohen）于2018年2月在斯坦福大学（太空证明）上演讲（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zlcgt8FVz4）。我们的顾问Dan Boneh，BenediktBünz和Ben Fisch [发布了VDF调查]（https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf），这是时间证明的基础技术。 Lipa Long [发布了有关班级分组的说明]（https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf），我们的《时间证明》（https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf）。根据[学术论文]，布拉姆于2018年1月在BPASE '18上展示了[超越Hellman的时间记忆权衡与空间证明的应用]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxkO7C-cyk） ]（https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893）和Hamza Abusalah的这些[幻灯片]（https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/pbase18slides/page/1）。 Ben Fisch在2018年1月的BPASE 2018上就可验证延迟功能进行了[演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUoagL7OZ1k）。 Bram [在伯克利的Blockchain发言人]（https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainatBerkeley/videos/2006069823011271/）（大约20:00开始）于2018年3月发布，带有[幻灯片]（https://cyber.stanford.com）。 edu / sites / g / files / sbiybj9936 / f / bramcohen.pdf）。布拉姆（Bram）在2017年1月发表了[在BPASE 2017上的演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYG0NxoG7yw），内容涉及用时空证明（[幻灯片]（https：//cyber.stanford .edu / sites / g / files / sbiybj9936 / f / bramcohen.pdf））。

    Bram在SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar上进行了[演讲]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4），讨论了使用[幻灯片]扩展比特币的数据结构（https://view.publitas.com/chia -network / bitcoin_data_structures /）和[Merkle Set代码]（https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet）。布拉姆（Bram）在SF比特币开发者研讨会上发表了有关消除加密货币浪费的演讲[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4]。

      heading: "VDF挑战"
      paragraph_1: "几个月前，我们结束了最初的VDF实施竞赛，并为提交的出色质量感到惊讶。前三名竞争者每人不到一分钟就进入了（参考实现是169秒）。另外五个小组还提交了比参考文献更快的实施方案。所有提交的内容都是开源的，可以在[此处](https://www.chia.net/2019/07/18/chia-vdf-competition-round-2-results-and-announcements.en.html)。最初的总奖金为100,000美元，但由于各团队在比赛中的辛勤工作，我们决定向提交参赛作品的每支团队奖励2,000美元，使总奖金达到116,000美元。"
      paragraph_2: "我们很自豪地宣布第二次竞赛，挑战参赛者以改进我们的新参考实施。"

      line_2: "1.允许SIMD和GPU优化"
      line_3: "2.不允许SIMD和GPU优化"
      paragraph: "这是为了帮助我们区分不同种类的优化。我们希望使用轨道1中允许的优化的条目会更快，但是并不需要轨道1提交使用这些技术。这意味着，所有第2条轨道的提交也有资格获得第1条轨道的提交。每个轨道的获胜者将获得50,000美元。邀请个人和团队参加。参赛者都可以使用Chia实验室的专用计算机。参考硬件的规范和更多技术细节可在我们的GitHub上获得。您可以在此处查看我们的预承诺(https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition)。比赛期间，参赛者将能够通过安全的Keybase渠道与Chia进行交流。"
